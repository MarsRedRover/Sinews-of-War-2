demd_pop_culture_conversion.1001.desc:0 "As I ride through a village in [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] I hear the jovial sounds of a marriage. I gesture my retinue to halt as we look benevolently upon the union.\n\nIt looks like a typical [desirable_culture.GetName] marriage at first, but then we see and hear unusual things. It seems many elements of [undesirable_culture.GetName] have made their way into the event. We are confused at first, but one of the notables leads a delegation to greet us.\n\nThey explain that it is in fact a mixed marriage, the groom being of [desirable_culture.GetName] culture whilst the bride is of [undesirable_culture.GetName] stock. They humbly ask us to bestow our blessing upon the marriage."

demd_pop_culture_conversion.1001.a:0 "I bless this union and the peace between [desirable_culture.GetCollectiveNoun] and [undesirable_culture.GetCollectiveNoun]!"

demd_pop_culture_conversion.1002.desc:0 "My chancellor has summoned his clerks for the monthly report. They all come bearing various letters, requests and legal acts. One of them though is reticent to give up his yield.\n\n"Sorry my lord, but large part of the acts in [county.GetName] have been drafted in the [undesirable_culture.GetName] language. I tried to encourage them to make an effort but they insisted on using their own tongue."\n\nWe cannot administrate effectively with a communication barrier.

demd_pop_culture_conversion.1003.desc:0 "With two cultures in [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], legal actions involving both [desirable_culture.GetCollectiveNoun] and [undesirable_culture.GetCollectiveNoun] are nothing short of nightmarish. While it would surely be advantageous to the legally savvy to keep the situation as is, the massive confusion brought on by this is too much trouble."

Their efforts are commendable and will benefit our influence in the area. As the elite learn our language we will have made a great step towards their integration.\n\nHowever, the Dean of the universities stubbornly refuses to accommodate [undesirable_culture.GetName]-speaking students. Speaking [desirable_culture.GetName] is a prerequisite of the teaching he insists, but that defeats the very objective of the classes to promote our language and customs."

demd_pop_culture_conversion.1005.desc:0 "While holding a council on minor matters of the realm, a junior clerk brings me a request: "[this.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], would it not be preferable if you proclaimed an edict that everyone in [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] is to adopt a [desirable_culture.GetName] name for administrative purposes. They take pride in their native [undesirable_culture.GetName] names but they are hard to transcribe accurately in our language. Moreover it would help them see the grandeur of our culture to name newborns according to our ways.""

demd_pop_culture_conversion.1006.desc:0 "My steward has come to me inquiring about the cadaster of [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Indeed, the property register is old and could use a rework. We could bias the survey towards [desirable_culture.GetName] landowners. Such a drastic move might have significant repercussions on my reputation, and will not go without resistance. I might even have a rebellion on my hands!\n\nOn the other hand, it would be a golden opportunity to push the hegemony of the [desirable_culture.GetName] people in [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], and an opportunity that may not come again."

When checking the entries for [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], he realized most all of the drafted men were of [desirable_culture.GetName] stock, a severe underuse of our military potential there.\n\nIf we could induct more [undesirable_culture.GetCollectiveNoun] in the levies we could boost our military potential whilst slowly accustoming them to our way of life. They will grow to admire and eventually, emulate us in their quest for better understanding."

demd_pop_culture_conversion.1007.a:0 "We will forge mutual understanding in the fires of war! Register all able bodied [undesirable_culture.GetCollectiveNoun]!"

Some ways to do that are sponsoring artists or construction projects.

However, the place has no shortage of literate [undesirable_culture.GetCollectiveNoun] who could fill up this role. They would also interface between their people and the wider [desirable_culture.GetName] bureaucracy.\n\nWe need to set up a standard for recruitment and to what extent [desirable_culture.GetName] language will be a used by them. We could end up fostering a local elite hostile to our aims instead of furthering our control if we don't proceed carefully."
